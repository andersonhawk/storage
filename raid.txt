### RAID theory ###

## RAID 0: striped set without redundancy ##
	raid 0 is a way of joining multi-disk together to create one big disk,
	the data is interleaved between the disks and so it improves performance,
	but there is no fault tolerance.

## RAID 1: mirroring ##
	raid 1 use with one disk mirroring the contents of the other disk.
	write performance is often slightly worse than one disk, but read performance
	is greatly improved as the data is avaiable in two planes and the read
	operation can be split between the two drivers.

## RAID 5: striped set with distributed parity ##
	raid 5 combine a larger number of physical disks, and still maintain
	some redundancy. it can be use 3 or more disks. if one disk fails, the
	date remains intact. both read and write performance usually increase.
	sizeof(RAID 5) = (n-1) * unit_size

## RAID 6: striped set with dual distributed parity ##
	raid 6 similar to RAID 5 except that the data is distributed to two
	other drives, the array can recover from the failure of two disks.
	it combines 4 or more disks.
	sizeof(RAID 6) = (n-2) * unit_size

## RAID 10: mirrored stripes ##
	raid 10 called raid 1+0 and is a RAID 1 array of two RAID 0 array.
	it can sustain multiple drive failures as long as the two failed drivers
	are part of the same RAID 0 set.
	the read performance is good and the write performance is better than
	RAID 1
